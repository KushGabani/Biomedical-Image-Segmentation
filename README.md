# Biomedical Image Segmentation

</center>

Pixel-level classification using a U-Net architecture for Biomedical Image Segmentation of Mitochondria

### The Dataset
For the `create_patches.py` script to run as expected, make sure you download the sub-volumes (including groundtruth sub-volumes) for both training and testing as our dataset.

You can download the dataset from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-em/)

## ðŸš€ Set up the environment locally
1. Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/KushGabani/Biomedical-Image-Segmentation.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory
```shell
cd Biomedical-Image-Segmentation
```
3. Create virtual environment using virtualenv
```shell
# Not required if already installed
pip install virtualenv  # (For Windows/Linux)
pip3 install virtualenv # (For Mac)

# Required
virtualenv venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment
```shell
source venv/bin/activate # (For Mac/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate # (For Windows)
```
4. Download the required dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### You have successfully setup the environment locally. âœ¨


## ðŸ¥“ Enlarge the dataset by splitting into small patches
A single image of the dataset is 768 x 1024, hence we will split each images and their respective masks in small patches that will be easier to process and also increase the number of images to train on.

> ðŸš¨ Make sure you create a new directory named `data` in the root of the project first before executing the script

Execute this command to run the `create_patches.py` script.
```shell
(For Windows)
python ./create_patches.py <dataset_root_directory> <patch_size>

(For Mac/Linux)
python3 ./create_patches.py <dataset_root_directory> <patch_size>
```
A patch size of 256 x 256 is used if not specified.
